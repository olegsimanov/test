[Expressions vs Statements](https://medium.com/launch-school/javascript-expressions-and-statements-4d32ac9c0e74)

in JavaScript, parens canâ€™t contain statements, because JavaScript treats everything within parens as an expression

Expression
-----
_Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an expression_

1. Arithmetic Expressions
2. String Expressions
3. Logical Expressions
4. Primary Expressions
5. Left-hand-side Expressions [(var obj; **(obj = new new OuterObj().InnerObj)**.Name = "Assigned";)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709866/whats-a-valid-left-hand-side-expression-in-javascript-grammar)
6. Assignment Expressions
7. Expressions with side effects
    
Statement
-----
_Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an expression_ 
Such actions include creating a variable or a function, looping through an array of elements, evaluating code based on a specific condition etc. JavaScript programs are actually a sequence of statements.
Statements in JavaScript can be classified into the following categories

1. Declaration Statements
2. Expression Statements
3. Conditional Statements
4. Loops and Jumps 
5. Function Expressions vs Function Declarations
