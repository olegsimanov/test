Use 'typeof' to find the type of an instance, e.g.

    typeof(Function)        => "function"       // a constructor function for a Function object
    typeof(Object)          => "function"       // a constructor function for an object

In JavaScript, **everything** that is not a primitive **is an object**. This includes _functions_, which are basically a _special type of object_ that can be "called" with the () syntax.
